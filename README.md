  <strong>A personal fork of mpvRx with improved automatic intro/outro skipping.</strong>
</p>

> ## About this fork

**mpvRx-skip** is a personal fork of [mpvRx](https://github.com/Riteshp2001/mpvRx) focused on improving automatic intro/outro skip detection.

### SkipDB improvements

- Automatic intro/outro skipping using **SkipDB**.
- Automatically resolves **TMDB IDs to IMDb IDs** when needed.
- No need to rename media files just to provide an IMDb ID.
- Uses **Wikidata** to resolve the IMDb ID from the TMDB ID.

The rest of the player remains based on the upstream **mpvRx** project.

Local playlist discovery runs when the Playlists page is first loaded and after media-index or storage-mount changes. Pull to refresh to rescan manually, or use **Playlist options > Add local playlist folder** to grant access to a folder. Android's restrictions on protected directories such as `Android/data` and `Android/obb` still apply; discovery cannot bypass them. HLS segment manifests are not imported as channel lists. Removing a discovered playlist does not delete its source file, and that source stays hidden until explicitly imported again. Remote video thumbnails respect the existing network-thumbnail setting.

## 🔋 Battery Optimization guide for Mpv

First Pro Tip Keep Mpv Conf empty if you are newbie

- **Use `gpu` not `gpu-next`** — gpu-next is a Vulkan-based renderer that keeps the GPU awake for no reason when playing normal video. The classic `gpu` backend is lighter and uses the OpenGL driver stack, which on most Android devices has better power characteristics.
- **Disable Vulkan entirely.** Vulkan is great for Video Playback but also Heavy.
- **Use the `fast` mpv profile.** It's literally built into mpvRx use that Mpv Profiles and Set it to Default  or in _mpv.conf_ `profile=fast`
- **Don't use shaders.** That Anime4K preset you using that's what's eating your battery. Shaders run on the GPU every single frame. If you're watching 24fps content and you have a shader pipeline running, congratulations — you're doing 24 unnecessary GPU compute passes per second for a Minute amount of visible benefit on a phone screen .
- **Don't use AI-generated configs.** That means you, the person who copied a Reddit config with 200 lines of `scale=ewa_lanczossharp` and `dscale=mitchell` and `cscale=sinc` and a dozen `glsl-shaders` entries. Most  of You have no idea what any of those do. You just made your phone render video like it's preparing for a 4K cinema projection. On a 6-inch screen. Grow some Brains Its your android Phone not some Fuckin.. 4k Television

**My POV:** mpv's default config with `profile=fast` and the `gpu` backend plays video with negligible battery impact — often **less** than OEM players because mpv doesn't have a billion proprietary DRM modules, analytics SDKs, and ad frameworks burning CPU in the background. The next time your battery drops more than 20-25% watching a 2-hour movie, don't blame mpv. Blame the 14 shaders you blindly copy-pasted.

_Just a Pro tip if your battery consumption stays within 200 mAh and belwo 0.9W ( See Page 6 of mpvRx - video player More Settings -> Page6) useage than ur Mpv Conf are Proper for Video watching thats what i have experimented and telling rest all i don't know About in detail technicality's if anyone wanna tell me In depth guide then keep it to yourself i dont wanna listen_

| `SIGNING_KEY_ALIAS` | Key alias inside the keystore |
| `SIGNING_STORE_PASSWORD` | Password for the keystore |
| `KEY_PASSWORD` | Password for the signing key |

Then bump `versionCode` and `versionName` in `app/build.gradle.kts`, create a tag, and push it:

```bash
git tag -a v1.3.1 -m "Release version 1.3.1"
git push origin v1.3.1
```

Preview releases use the same flow with preview tags such as:

```bash
git tag -a v1.3.1-preview.1 -m "Preview release"
git push origin v1.3.1-preview.1
```
